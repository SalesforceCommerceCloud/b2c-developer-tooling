Adds complete MRT CLI coverage organized by scope: `mrt project` (CRUD, members, notifications), `mrt env` (CRUD, variables, redirects, access-control, cache invalidation, B2C connections), `mrt bundle` (deploy, list, history, download), `mrt org` (list, B2C instances), and `mrt user` (profile, API key, email preferences).
