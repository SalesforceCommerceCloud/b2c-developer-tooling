# Benefits over sfcc-ci

- stateless auth by default
- modern node (Typescript, async/await, etc)
  - separate CLI and SDK packages
- structured logging, json output on all commands
  - specific errors (no more webdav generic error)
- localization support
- command organization
  - for instance separating AM management into it's own topic (client, user, role)
