# Package dw.util

## Classes
| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ArrayList](dw.util.ArrayList.md) | The ArrayList class is a container for a list of objects. |
| [Assert](dw.util.Assert.md) | The Assert class provides utility methods for assertion events. |
| [BigInteger](dw.util.BigInteger.md) | The BigInteger class is a helper class to represent an arbitrary long integer number. |
| [Bytes](dw.util.Bytes.md) | A simple immutable class representing an array of bytes, used for working  with binary data in a scripting context. |
| [Calendar](dw.util.Calendar.md) | Represents a Calendar and is based on the java.util.Calendar  class. |
| [Collection](dw.util.Collection.md) | Represents a collection of objects. |
| [Currency](dw.util.Currency.md) | Represents a currency supported by the system. |
| [DateUtils](dw.util.DateUtils.md) | A class with several utility methods for Date objects. |
| [Decimal](dw.util.Decimal.md) | The Decimal class is a helper class to perform decimal arithmetic in  scripts and to represent a decimal number with arbitrary length. |
| [FilteringCollection](dw.util.FilteringCollection.md) | [FilteringCollection](dw.util.FilteringCollection.md) is an extension of  [Collection](dw.util.Collection.md) which provides possibilities to   <ul>  <li>_filter_ the elements to return a new  [FilteringCollection](dw.util.FilteringCollection.md) with a filtered set of elements</li>  <li>_sort_ the elements to return a new  [FilteringCollection](dw.util.FilteringCollection.md) with a defined sort order</li>  <li>_transform_ the elements to return a new  [FilteringCollection](dw.util.FilteringCollection.md) containing related elements</li>  <li>_provide a map_ of the elements against a predefined key</li>  </ul> |
| [Geolocation](dw.util.Geolocation.md) | Read-only class representing a position on the earth (latitude and longitude)  and information associated with that location (e.g. |
| [HashMap](dw.util.HashMap.md) | Represents a hash map of objects. |
| [HashSet](dw.util.HashSet.md) | Represents a HashSet |
| [Iterator](dw.util.Iterator.md) | The Iterator class allows you to access items in a collection. |
| [LinkedHashMap](dw.util.LinkedHashMap.md) | This class implements a HashMap, which guarantees a iteration order  according the put-order of the elements in the map. |
| [LinkedHashSet](dw.util.LinkedHashSet.md) | The class LinkedHashSet implements a hash set with a guaranteed iteration  order. |
| [List](dw.util.List.md) | An ordered collection of objects. |
| [Locale](dw.util.Locale.md) | Represents a Locale supported by the system. |
| [Map](dw.util.Map.md) | Represents a Map of objects. |
| [MapEntry](dw.util.MapEntry.md) | The class represent an entry within a Map. |
| [MappingKey](dw.util.MappingKey.md) | Encapsulates the key for a mapping read in with the ImportKeyValueMapping job step. |
| [MappingMgr](dw.util.MappingMgr.md) | Used to manage and interface with mappings loaded into the system via the ImportKeyValueMapping job step. |
| [PropertyComparator](dw.util.PropertyComparator.md) | This comparator can be used for the List sort() methods and for the SortSet  and SortedMap classes. |
| [SecureEncoder](dw.util.SecureEncoder.md) | SecureEncoder contains many methods for manipulating untrusted data Strings  into RFC-Compliant Strings for a given context by encoding "bad" data into  the proper format. |
| [SecureFilter](dw.util.SecureFilter.md) | SecureFilter contains many methods for manipulating untrusted data Strings  into RFC-Compliant Strings for a given context by removing "bad" data from  the untrusted data. |
| [SeekableIterator](dw.util.SeekableIterator.md) | A special Iterator, which is returned by the system to iterate through large  sets of data. |
| [Set](dw.util.Set.md) | Represents a set of objects. |
| [SortedMap](dw.util.SortedMap.md) | A map that further guarantees that it will be in ascending key order,  sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys,  or by a comparator provided at sorted map creation time. |
| [SortedSet](dw.util.SortedSet.md) | A set that further guarantees that its iterator  will traverse the set in ascending element order,  sorted according to the natural ordering of its  elements (only supported for Number, String,  Date, Money and Quantity), or by a comparator  provided at sorted set creation time. |
| [StringUtils](dw.util.StringUtils.md) | String utility class. |
| [Template](dw.util.Template.md) | Reads an ISML template from the file system and renders it into a  [MimeEncodedText](dw.value.MimeEncodedText.md) object. |
| [UUIDUtils](dw.util.UUIDUtils.md) | Utility methods around generating unique IDs. |
